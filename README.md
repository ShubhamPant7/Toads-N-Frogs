Toads-N-Frogs is an implementation of Toads-N-Frogs, as specified [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toads_and_Frogs), with one subtle difference, each player has a "do-nothing" move. Also implemented is an AI-player, which uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize move choice.
